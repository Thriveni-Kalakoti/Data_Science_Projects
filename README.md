# 🧠 Data Science Projects

This repository showcases my hands-on learning and practical applications in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. Each project is built from scratch using real or open datasets and follows a structured, problem-solving approach.

## 📁 Projects Included

| Project | Description | Tools/Tech |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Student Score Predictor | Simple linear regression to predict student marks based on study hours | Python, Pandas, scikit-learn |

## 📌 Project Structure

Each project folder typically contains:

- `README.md` – Explains the project objective, dataset, methods, and results
- `.ipynb` or `.py` files – Clean, documented code (often via Google Colab)
- `plots/` or `outputs/` – Any generated visuals or result files

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression & Classification Algorithms
- Model Evaluation Metrics

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Solve business-style problems using machine learning
- Practice data preprocessing and cleaning
- Apply modeling and evaluation techniques
- Visualize insights clearly for non-technical audiences
- Document work with clarity and purpose

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can view each project by navigating into its folder and opening the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📌 Notes

- All projects are built independently as part of my journey toward mastering data science.
- Datasets used are publicly available or generated for learning purposes.
