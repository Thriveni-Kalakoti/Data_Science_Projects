# Student Score Predictor

## Objective
This project predicts student exam scores based on study hours using a simple linear regression model.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Steps Followed
1. Load data and explore it
2. Visualize relationship between hours and scores
3. Train Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate with RÂ² Score & MSE
5. Predict for new study hour inputs

## How to Run
- Open `student_score_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

##  What I Learned
- Basics of regression in machine learning
- Importance of visualization in analysis
- Model training & evaluation workflow
